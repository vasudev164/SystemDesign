SOLID principles ->

S -> Single Responsibility
O -> Open/Closed principle - Open for extension, closed for modification
L -> Liskov Substitution - Parent class should be able to replaceble by child class - Meaning all the methods in parent class must work in child class.
I - Interface Segmentation - Classes should not be forced to implement the all methods in interface. If needed create a new interface and use this.
D - Dependency Inversion - Always code in abstraction means with Interface
